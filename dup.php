                    <br/> These technologies tell us when you are logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features.
                    <br/> For example, Cookies and similar technologies tell us when you logged in on Brands-app so we can show you relevant and social plug-in information when you visit other websites that use our social plug-in.
